- @TimofeyMarko [13 minutes ago]: Let‚Äôs get Kramnik stripped of his titles, and banned from all chess events.
- @enxx2362 [14 minutes ago]: Is there evidence that the Kramnik situation caused the passing of Naroditsky? These are very severe accusations and should not be made without any strong, unequivocal evidence. RIP Danya.
- @chreeshawn [14 minutes ago]: really breaks my heart. rip danya & kramnik needs to be excommunicated
- @epaguag [17 minutes ago]: Emil Sutovsky‚Äôs post is disgusting beyond words. It is nothing less than an attack on Danya‚Äôs friends and family at a time of their greatest pain. SHAME on him and FIDE. He should resign immediately. RIP Danyaüíî
- @afuzzycreature8387 [20 minutes ago]: i do not see stripping kramnik of what he has earned is fair.  I do support the banishment from professional chess.
- @Chr15T [20 minutes ago]: Danya's death is very tragic.  On the Kramnik accusations I would like to ask, is anyone still taking them seriously? I watch Epic Chess and other channels, and they constantly make jokes about it. Quite good jokes! - and I think these accusations have hurt Kramnik himself more than any of his targets.  But if (!) Danya really took Kramnik that seriously, that would mean he saw the center of his life in his chess play, and his strength at chess as defining for his self-regard - both would be, given his youth, attractiveness and economic safety, totally wrong. He was certainly much more than a chess player. Heck, even within the chess world, he was much more than merely another grandmaster.  But given the incredible capabilities of his mind, he was apparently also able to suffer more than most would in his situation. Still, for what others are speculating here, I don't believe this alone (!) can be the sole motivation for an intentional death. Much more, a combination of factors which end up in accident.   As a side remark, living in Europe, I don't know a single person who at the age of 29 takes sleeping pills. In the USA, however, this is apparently a common thing.  RIP Danya.
- @Jaalgarc [21 minutes ago]: Terribly sorry for your loss Levy. The pain of knowing you won‚Äôt see or speak to a good friend again is brutal unlike anything else. Rip Danya.  I‚Äôm not all that familiar with chess outside of these videos but anyone blaming friends not being there on the internet are delusional to the concept of chronic depression, it will mask itself a lot of times as some of the happiest most social people but deep down they are fighting for any purpose to continue. Unfortunately they decide that ultimatum is their only way out from all of the pain and torment and i promise it‚Äôs not a spontaneous decision. Breaks my heart knowing Danya has carried this suffering for who knows how many years. I hope you found paradise brother.
- @TautologyTechSystems [22 minutes ago]: Two things should happen immediately:  1. FIDE CEO resigns or is removed from his position. 2. Kramnik is stripped of his titles and permanently banned from any tournaments or events.  The top 100 players should refuse to play until these two things happen.
- @oak_a [23 minutes ago]: RIP. Seems like we found the Billy Mitchell of the chess world
- @JoshVanDerWood [26 minutes ago]: Daniel was my favorite commentator. Not only a great chessmaster, teacher, creator, but a great guy as well. RIP Danya ü§çü§çü§ç
- @NoooTheWall32 [30 minutes ago]: Haven‚Äôt watched or played chess in about 3-4 years. The last times I have tuned in was the Hikaru cheating accusations and checked the World Championship results. I was shocked just like everyone to Daniel passing away, cause I had no idea what was going on. I had no idea Daniel was even accused of cheating until now. The fact that it‚Äôs the same person that was accusing players last time I tuned in is insane but not surprising considering the past. RIP to Danya
- @a.j.leclair5426 [32 minutes ago]: Rip Danya
- @jersky3624 [34 minutes ago (edited)]: FIDE should strip everything from Kramnik or FIDE should die as an organization. Sutovsky needs to resign as well - what an ugly, disgusting statement from someone in a position of authority.
- @TheLyingLeft [36 minutes ago]: Gone too soon. RIP, Danya. Also, Kramnik is a piece of shit.
- @cliveas [39 minutes ago]: RIP Danya...this shows how being wrongfully accused and having your reputation ruined can do to a person...I hope this is a wake up call to all people who spread hate even on social media...even people who sometimes watch Levy and hate in the comments yall dont know how deep words cut...this goes for people who till this day hate on Hans Niemann or call him a cheater for what happened against Magnus ...cause for me the situations are very similar ...hans has that reputation or public image that he's a cheater which almost ruined his career and still affects him today...STOP SPREADING HATE AND LIES
- @rvs2677 [42 minutes ago]: Emil Bitchovsky needs to be fired asap. How is he even allowed to tweet like this being a higher up in the International Chess Federation? He talks like a conspiracy podcast grifter with no absolutely no awareness.   Kramnik on the other hand needs to be locked in an asylum and stripped of everything he ever accomplished along with never seeing the light of the outside world.
- @Kawabolole [43 minutes ago]: This is a story of harassment and defamation. Harassment takes many forms, and some people are more vulnerable to it than others. Maybe bright and kind hearted people are its easiest victims, as they cannot wrap their heads around how a fellow human being could act in such a way, just out of pure spite, potentially destroying other peoples lives and reputations, for no reason at all. The Internet is dangerous for those who seek validation from outside of themselves. Many of his "alleged friends" probably thought "f that guy, he's out of his mind, there's no way Danya could ever care so much that he harms himself". And even if they did check on him, he probably diminished it himself so as not to make people worry about him, out of kindness... As it is often the case. Harassment is everywhere, and it can involve very influential people, both as the harasser and harassee. Maybe this is the lesson. Maybe this is an opportunity to see that it is real. That it may affect even people who are actually strong enough to build such a career and such an influence, as well as other, non-public people. Maybe actual justice needs to deal with that evil man, or maybe he's just making his own life miserable and is already paying the price for it. Cause now he has the choice between basically admitting he's a murderer or drowning into his own lies. Because now, Danya being a cheater is not enough anymore, hell, even if he was, did he deserve this? So the last resort is substance abuse, "the chess mafia". But we all heard what Danya said on his last stream, Vladimir, and you did, too. RIP Danya
- @harmbooij8241 [43 minutes ago]: As someone who was close to his own demise, decades ago, no friend could have stopped it. If presented with the question. It is the loneliest choice a person has to make. RIP Daniel and condolences to all hie friends in the broadest terms possible.
- @kingshark9057 [44 minutes ago]: I have to honest i hope this doesn't come across the wrong way but i see no point in stripping titles and banning kramnik it changes nothing and only offers shallow if that comfort to naroditskys family and all the drama that would outpour from that would just strengthen hatred misinformation and toxicity in the chess world karmniks supporters will fully believe theres silencing from some chess mafia and nothing will change The right way in going about this for me is for the chess world to come together against toxicity in chess FIDE need to stop their bullshit and make a clear stance against baseless accusations and harassment there need to be support systems in place for players for those who are always in the limelight aswell as lesser known players who wouldn't have the support of large fanbases FIDE need to actively move to change the culture in chess while unfortunately i don't have the answers myself there need to be interactions between players fans and officials to find ways to create friendly respectful and inclusive spaces all throughout chess but thats just my piece
- @devil_gaming_ultra [45 minutes ago]: Very useful video Levy, Rip Daniel Naroditsky
- @9volt65 [47 minutes ago]: No pin of shame fishing. Thank you for speaking up about this, Gotham. This stuff hurts to see. Kramnik needs to be stripped of his titles and Emil must step down.
- @buggah_man [48 minutes ago]: Man monetize this video. I know you're doing it so that people don't think you're milking this for profit but there's reason not to. If anything you can use the money from the video to help his family with the funeral costs. Much respect for what you're doing. I know you're doing it with a good heart. RIP Danya. He deserved so much better
- @coreyaustin3966 [48 minutes ago]: This whole situation breaks my heart. What a disgusting person Kramnik is, I'd say man, but he's not a man. He's a pathetic, belligerent old fool.   RIP Danya.
- @SupermanKrypto277 [51 minutes ago]: I was about to write something against this guy Kramnik and call him murderer or bully,but Danya if he is looking from above would want us to forgive him because the guy was an angel he was the nicest person that the world has ever seen,the reason why God took him so early because he doesent want his people his angels to suffer for too long here on earth .So i wish Kramnik to have a long and prosperous life to live up to 150 years and to continue to accuse this generation of chess players and the next one and the next of cheating to continue to be torchured by his own hatefull and miserable mind to continue to fill his black void that is his soul with more hate more anger in hope to find peace and joy one day. RIP Danya
- @BradleyGerity [52 minutes ago]: RIP Daniel üò¢. Love you
- @FinnCaseyFletcher [54 minutes ago]: RIP Daniel ‚ù§
- @EricaPani-uh5vr [54 minutes ago]: I have been so shocked to see how the various powers that be in the world of chess have allowed Kramnik to continue his evil witch hunts against a range of players. Kramnik is a disgrace, and he should be stripped of his precious titles and blocked from all tournaments etc. If it ends up that Daniel took his own life, then Kramnik is directly to blame for pushing him so far
- @speeky77 [54 minutes ago]: Something like this is outrageous. FIDE is so corrupted and bad, and I think the reaction says it all. Two sentences mentioning the real problem and then twenty sentences blaming those who supported Danya is crazy. Krammnik needs to be punished as severly as possible, and Emil Sutovsky should step down from his position as he is clearly not able to hold up right and manners in the community he is supposed to oversee at least partially. RIP Daniel Naroditsky
- @mrbl5234 [1 hour ago]: there is nothing that could have prevented what happened, we all have a breaking point, and i genuinely think Kramnik thought he was right and probably still does but his bullying lead to this terrible end of your friend, life is just unfair and always will be. rip Daniel.
- @mohamedkallel3976 [1 hour ago (edited)]: a generational hater needs a generational diss. that kramnik guy sucks. rip danya hope that karma works its magic
- @AgnieszkaPoznanska-Aga [1 hour ago]: 12:29 I have heard somewhere lately that narcissists don‚Äôt stop or withdraw, they just reload. What you have said about the situation fits the narcissistic script.
- @RandyPeterMuzic [1 hour ago]: If Fide can strip all Russian players off their flag for human rights uninvolved with chess then they can at the least strip Kramnik of all of his chess accolades for Danya!
- @stephenber2114 [1 hour ago]: Thank you Levy. Danya's life, name, and legacy will be remembered and honored. You are proof that there is a large community within the chess world that is not okay with this, and will not let any of it slide, Danya was too important to many to let that happen. RIP Daniel Naroditsky.
- @bugmonkey9226 [57 minutes ago]: I thought the RIP Daniel Naroditsky video meant he lost some games üòÇ
- @relaxationmeditation499 [1 hour ago]: Kramnick is trying to help. Someone elses death can't be put on him unless he physically took it.  Rip Daniel.
- @tat2dgerl [1 hour ago]: Internet trolls (even grandmaasters) know they can use shock and conspiracy to get attention.  I really hope to see chess unite against these practices.  Let this young man's death have a positive affect on procedure so there aren't more.  RIP Daniel.
- @gakechi2 [1 hour ago (edited)]: Kramnik should be banned from competing in any future events or matches. He should also be publicly denounced and stripped of his GM title by FIDE and every other international chess organization.
- @SmartCrazyGambit [1 hour ago]: RIP dany and fuck kramnik
- @AutumnGray101 [1 hour ago]: First of all, RIP to Danya, truly a tragedy beyond proportion. Hopefully a real conversation happens now, on the issue of online toxicity and cheating accusations. It‚Äôs awful that things like this are needed nowadays to bring focus and attention to such glaring problems.
- @sajdhakai3131 [1 hour ago (edited)]: Never thought I‚Äôd defend a d-bag like Kramnik, but he didn‚Äôt kill anyone. What happened is not a normal response to accusations from a schizophrenic. Stop being reductionists over the complexity of mental health. Putting all the blame on Kramnik just makes you ignorant of the larger infrastructural problems in the community which wasn‚Äôt able to save Daniel. RIP
- @ZMHealing [1 hour ago]: Emil's post screams of phoniness, ego-based corporate superiority. It reminds me of an automated job application denial email from HR.  Psilocybin mushrooms need to be force-fed to these people - it's the only way to rip the cringe ego from their insecure souls.
- @parthavvari2384 [1 hour ago (edited)]: The thing that is so sickening - and I hope to be proved wrong - is that FIDE and Kramnik will not do anything to change - Kramnik will still be in his own bubble crying about top GMS and cheating and FIDE will continue to do nothing about him; RIP to Daniel Naroditsky, the greatest chess commentator of all time
- @connorpowers2786 [1 hour ago]: Emil needs to strip Kramnik of his titles and then he needs to resign. Enough is enough
- @ImpostorDrome [1 hour ago]: CEO of FIDE needs to be fired ASAP!! He's pure evil for this response, I'm sorry, I just can't see how his moral compass is that of a sane human after making this statement. No way that can be the CEO of FIDE!! Kramnik also needs to be punished, strip him of his title, he cause so much damage to the chess world with his reckless actions!
- @alexandergavrilov1792 [1 hour ago]: I have a huge respect to Danya as a person from his streams lessons and interviews. And here Levy started accusations, bullying, appeals to ban people and requests to sign petitions  even  before the body is buried. I understand emotions and state of mind, but this way of thinking is weak.  Chess is about passion and joining people, showing them respect and support. It is very sad to see that  once a good  chess channel  disseminating hate. RIP Danya. You made this World a  better place.
- @bahrfod [1 hour ago]: FIDE should strip Kramnik for his GM title and world champion titles. Period.
- @kagekowalski250 [1 hour ago]: Why is everyone agreeing that Kramnik is in the wrong for baselessly accusing Danya of cheating, when Magnus and Hikaru have repeatedly done the same to Hans' over-the-board tournament play? They've done everything they can to destroy his career and reputation, and no one cares. We need to hold everyone accountable, not just Kramnik.  RIP Danya
- @CdnBloodlust [1 hour ago]: Im so disgustted  i am such a big fan RIP
- @LixiPlays [1 hour ago]: He's in a better place now.. RIP and JUSTICE FOR DANYA!! üïäÔ∏èüò¢
- @roycaspi6843 [1 hour ago]: It is more than possible that Krammnik is a KGB agent whom works for the KGB in order to create chaos in the development of the USA chess community in particular and on the western community in general. It is more than only delusional jealousy of top young generation of GMs it is we‚Äôll force power of highly manipulate and mind control of young souls in order to crest terror and low self esteem in the young western community. That‚Äôs why I posed that Krammnik and his team work for higher hierarchy of manipulation. If this thought seems intelligibility to you passed it forward. May Daniel Soul RIP
- @Artcrias [1 hour ago]: They need to formally strip him of his titles, bar him from any future events, and let his legacy be forgotten. In ANY other sport, at a minimum the governing body would have at least banned him before any of this could've snowballed, instead, it took a years long harassment and smear campaign against one of their most beloved players, public uproar and a death before they even addressed the issue. It's time to start looking at FIDE
- @andriusambrutis343 [1 hour ago]: Let's be honest, all mind games are exhausting, and it has a toll on people minds. Even Hikaru was thinking about quitting the career after losing several tournaments, but he stayed, probably because many people supported him. It must be really hard when people online are criticizing even the tiniest mistakes you make. Some of those people are bullying just for attention. It is not okay, and I hope that after this tragedy this uncivilized behaviour will change. Chess players, probably as other people who are involved in work requiring heavy thinking, undergo a lot of stress and I hope that instead of blaming them, people will support them. I didn't know Daniel in person, but in videos he looked like a kind person, and that kindness was motivating. It is a sad day not just for the chess community, but for humanity itself. RIP.
- @mek1011 [1 hour ago]: I don't see anything wrong with his tweet. Everything he said is beyond valid. If it wasn't u wouldn't b upset about it. Clearly kramnik is the original antagonist, and deserves to b held accountable for making such merit less accusations. But what he said seems tru. These accusations didn't happen recently. This has been an ongoing situation. This is not brand new. Ppl clearly knew Danya was not doing well recently. Not saying that anything could have been done to avoid this. Ultimately Danya was a grown man who made his decision. Weather we agree with it or not, it was his life and his and only his decision to make. RIP Danya
- @Fixologist1 [1 hour ago]: 12:34 There is a 'dark spirit'. You will never change it because it's been here and ruled this world since the beginning of mankind. But there IS victory over it. Have faith. RIP Danya.
- @rodrigomunoz6496 [1 hour ago]: Daniel Naroditsky RIP
- @Fatemaa-q1w [1 hour ago]: Rip daniel...
- @badcat3817 [1 hour ago]: Thanks a lot Levy for your honest thoughts. I admired Daniel a lot for being a super bright human, a fantastic chess teacher and i thought he had a very pleasant aura as a human being. When i heard about his death i was devasted even though i did not know Daniel personally. Hearing about what lead to this tragedy makes this even worse. Thanks again Levy for the clarification. I have no hate for Kramnik but i guess he deserves hell. There is that song: You can run on for a long time, sooner or later gods gonna cut you down. All the best to you Levy, the friends and family of Daniel. RIP Daniel.
- @fake-reugniebgeogjp23 [1 hour ago (edited)]: If this was a s..e, it's on Kramnik ‚Äî he cyberbullied him. If this was a d...gs o...dose, as Kramnik "assumes," it's still on Kramnik ‚Äî Danya would started doing d..gs only because of all the hate he got from those accusations. Kramnik SHOULD've thought that it would be his accusations that would hurt Danya the most, since Kramnik was his idol. I hope Kramnik will have the dignity to at least apologize for his past (and current) behavior. RIP Danya
- @arnevesper [1 hour ago]: Im never happy when I see posts on the news when celebrities have died, but I also usually dont have a big reaction. This was covered in norwegian news, and it hit me, I almost couldnt believe it, truly sad.  I dont know what to say about kramnik, he seems actually insane, but I hope FIDE strips him of everything chess related. And my condolences to everyone who knew him.. rip
- @rorykeegan1895 [1 hour ago]: RIP Danya, he will be much missed by many.  Take a deep breath, and take as much feedback as you can from your peer group, before you go for the appalling Kramnik. Have a word with Gary Chess before tackling FIDE, he has been down that path before and has much to offer in terms of advice. Between yourself, Hikaru and the other streamers you have an enormous audience, hence much influence. You alone have 6.8m people standing solidly behind you on this one. This stuff has to stop.
- @Pope-wq2nf [1 hour ago]: RIP Danya
- @imreliq9774 [1 hour ago]: ‚Ä™The dirty man has his shit blocked so he can dish out and not receive. But the double standard and hypocrisy of the way he‚Äôs attacking those for false allegations is narcissism incarnate. This man is scum, and I truly hope he gets everything coming his way. ‚Ä¨ I pray FIDE strips him of everything. I hope he loses chess as a way of life.
- @zaandros [1 hour ago]: You can revoke Grand Master titles. It‚Äôs a honour bestowed upon you by FIDE, similar to the honour system in the UK, you can be stripped of your honours.  Sure, we can‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt revoke the world championship title, that‚Äôs a fixed point in history and you can‚Äôt pretend it didn‚Äôt happen.
- @mapsgillnet6762 [1 hour ago]: Kramnik Trump will only stop when he's held legally accountable and stripped of his titles and barred from the chess community until he gets mental help and apologizes profusely.
- @immanuelkant7895 [1 hour ago]: Strip Kramnik of his world championship title and GM status
- @Krizlyyy [1 hour ago]: I am not sure but in the end it was daniels decision and neither the friends nor some weird guy can be fully blamed for it.   Its a bad decision by him - and I think if this bad decision also destroys others peoples lifes - lifes of awful people - then this incentivises other people also to make this bad decision (in hope it destroys their enemies)  Still RIP Daniel
- @112233JORDAN [1 hour ago]: I'm genuinely curious if Hans had committed suicide after Magnus' false accusations during the Sinquefield Cup, would there be similar calls for Magnus to be stripped of his title (because he has and continues to be bullied on a world stage)? I wish Danya actually did what Hans did after he faced similar accusations from Kramnik. Hans said, "Let's train and let me show you." That being said, the behavior of Kramnik is abhorrent and I was a huge fan of Daniel Naroditsky for at least 5 years now and am deeply saddened by his passing. This is in no way his fault and I believe he never cheated.
- @jacksonlong4502 [2 hours ago]: I'm sorry for your loss, Levy. Danya was an excellent chess teacher. The crap that Kramnik is spewing is vile. I hope he faces serious consequences. FIDE should strip him of his title.
- @chriso6884 [2 hours ago]: Well said. I came across the video of Danya's last twitch stream and it was shocking. Very difficult to watch. In some ways I wish I'd never seen it, but it did provide some valuable context. I hope there is some way to hold Kramnik accountable but I fear nothing will be done.  RIP Danya.
- @danielw8620 [2 hours ago]: Unpopular opinion but Kramnik is not the catalyst of why it happened. It's turning 30 and not reaching where you want to be in life (his birthday was coming up next month).  Not being champion, not having a wife, family, kids, dog etc.  When you turn 30 as a man you have a semi 1/3rd life crisis ie "society said im supposed to have this that and this".  And it's actually really common to not have everything at 30 anymore with how the economy has been in the past 10-15 years with the multiple recessions etc.  Kramnik didn't help and may have been the straw that broke the camels back but to act like he was the main source of it is just most likely incorrect.  I say this because that existential dread of growing older and not being happy at where you are at and feeling hopeless is the main cause and should be more openly talked about to prevent future instances like this.  RIP Danya, he really helped me learn alot about chess during the boom during Covid.
- @vandanaghildiyal7856 [2 hours ago]: Rip daniel
- @Ali.Qurbani [2 hours ago]: Kramnik needs to be put in an insane asylum with no access to internet üò¢üò¢üò¢. RIP to one of the nicest and well spoken chess player of our time
- @uwd9we [2 hours ago]: Let's not be silly and pretend an individual kills themself due to an accusation of cheating. Also, the calls for retrospective punishments such as stripping Kramnik of his titles and records are reckless and verge on fascistic mob rule. Nobody ought to lose sight of the real tragedy being that a brilliant young person has passed away in wretchedly sad circumstances.
- @thelupo9481 [2 hours ago]: It's important that the big players finally take a stand against Kramnik and his baseless, harsh cheating accusations. Sensitive souls like Daniel must have been deeply affected, and very few voices spoke up in his defense. RIP Daniel
- @matthalpin6656 [2 hours ago]: RIP Danya. You are a legend who has helped so many people. Kramnik has got too comfortable behind his computer screen, being a despicable, evil person who will not listen to reason or consider another perspective or person's rationale on things. There has to be repercussions to his actions. Some good old fashioned justice. To do what he has done takes a truly sick individual. To live like he has just accusing left and right... if your life sucks, stop taking it out on others. Stop projecting. Stop bullying. Stop harassing. When did we forget we are all human navigating this life as best we can.. Kramnik deserves everything that comes his way. Pathetic excuse for a human.
- @MautozTech [2 hours ago]: Why does everyone still care about what kramnik says? You should've stopped long ago.  RIP chess legend
- @vozhik27 [2 hours ago]: Levy, you did absolutely right by ignoring Kramnik‚Äôs hysteria. That should not be given free exposure. The ‚Äúfriends‚Äô responsibility‚Äù theme has been raised by Kramnik himself, as well as some other crap not worth be mentioned. Don‚Äôt it let get under your skin. There are always vultures who thrive on suffering of others. Don‚Äôt let them.  I wanna say for those who comment: we, the audience, should not forget about our responsibility as well. It‚Äôs very easy to leave a comment or tweet or whatever it is without understanding how can it influence the guy on the other side of the screen. Don‚Äôt empower those who damage others just to feed their demons.  RIP, –î–∞–Ω—è.
- @Tridec13 [2 hours ago]: We need to take measures to remove bullying from our beloved e-sports.  RIP Hax$.  RIP Danya.
- @maherazzzouzi279 [2 hours ago]: kramnik should shut the fk up‚Ä¶. he is ruining the game and applying unnecessary pressure to top GMs. RIP Daniel Naroditsky I got goosebumps hearing the news‚Ä¶. I love you Danya ‚ù§
- @murkyfluid7625 [2 hours ago]: Kramnik should be stripped of his status as a former world champion.  He is garbage.  Justice for danya.
- @kianpaya360 [2 hours ago]: Strip Kramnik of all his titles.
- @i.r.weasel7042 [2 hours ago]: 1. RIP Danya.  2. Kramnik is likely clinical with mental illness.   3. FIDE needs to set up a system for cheating accusations, and they need a private arbitration  process. If you're in FIDE and go around the system then you get banned.   We can't allow unhinged people to drag people's reputation and livelihood through hell without evidence and without consequences from false claims.   (Chess has a bit of a dark history of mentally ill people and that should be recognized with sensitivity)
- @luismartin6620 [2 hours ago]: Dude, I really hate Kramnik. RIP Danya
- @stevehoward9356 [2 hours ago]: For what it's worth, from me : THANK YOU Levy. It's been a tough few days for everyone who follows chess, but I cannot imagine how his family and friends are coping with this. However, I'm sure that they are all in our prayers. RIP Danya, you were loved by many, many people. If we were all remiss in our support - then i'm sure we are sorry. If we were short in our support - then I'm sure we are sorry. Please know that NOTHING that anyone will say will ever diminish the love we felt (and still feel) for you.
- @Tj_wav [2 hours ago]: Kramnik needs  -His world championship stripped -His gm title stripped -charged tor third degree murder -banned from as many social media platforms as possible
- @Freddy-gc5wn [2 hours ago]: You read it here first, but watch Kramnik making it about himself. Like he is the victim. Some obscure mafia actually killed Danya to make the hate against Kramnik even bigger. I can totally see those arguments coming from him.   RIP Danya, we will miss you!
- @Swetark-b6k [2 hours ago]: Kramnik deserves to be stripped of hos GM title and WC title, he should be banned from FIDE and should boycotted frankly. I dont usually comment but this just bullshit, the CEO of FIDE should take that shit back. Levy i absolutely support you and u r right
- @cletus2580 [2 hours ago]: We all know who is to blame. Fide needs to take action against Kramnik, strip his title for one thing. Fide president needs to resign for doing absolutely nothing for all this time.
- @WellsInvisible [2 hours ago]: Kramnik must be stripped of the title of World Champion, as it never belonged to him and no one to this day is quite sure how he was able to win the match against Kasparov (and Topalov as well). It is a disgrace for chess to have a psychopath chasing and accusing with impunity anyone who wins a game against him.
- @davidblaine9920 [2 hours ago]: I agree that Kramnik should be stripped from all chess related content. Where was this energy when Hans was accused by magnus and hikaru. Don't even like Hans but seeing how flase allegations could destroy someone i must say Gotham using his platform to further the buttplug theory was disappointing. I do hope danya gets his justice from FIDE.
- @cameronbodell7985 [2 hours ago]: Levy, thank you for acknowledging justice as part of the grieving process. RIP to a legend and a good man. Emil's response tells me that FIDE won't do shit unless forced through its ethics and disciplinary procedures. Affected players should compile evidence of Kramnik's misconduct and submit a complaint arguing that Kramnik's conduct violates FIDE's ethics code, calling for an investigation, Kramnik's title revocation (unlikely but worth pushing for), and/or permanently banning Kramnik from FIDE events (more likely). If we're serious about justice through FIDE, the complaint process coupled with public pressure seems to be the way forward. In additional to FIDE recourse, it might also be worth (1) seeking support from the U.S Chess Federation (since Danya was an American GM), and (2) reporting Kramnik to his active social media platforms for violating their harassment/cyber bullying policies.
- @buzzspiker [2 hours ago]: Danya taught me that being the best isnt important, its more important to focus on sharing your love for the game with others, and fostering a healthy community. Danya had what it takes to become world champion, but he knew what it would mean to push for that, and instead he focused on spreading joy to others, and helping them reach their goals and fullfilment. RIP danya, you taught me so much, and helped me through a time when I was depressed, as im sure he did many others. One of the most genuine, high integrity, kind people on the face of the planet who just wanted to spread joy through the game he loved, and share that love with everyone else‚ù§.

- @mm5hon [2 hours ago]: Stay strong Levi. The Devil is real. Demons are real. Keep the faith and keep talking with those you trust through the pain. Know that you are adored by literally millions, and loved dearly by your wife and friends. It's times like this the Serenity Prayer concisely covers the situation. "Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I must, and the wisdom to know the difference." The death of a friend is always devastating; I have, unfortunately experienced it myself. Let yourself feel and express the pain, but focus on the good. Stay safe our friend and when the demons try to pull you down, just remember the good and focus your whole being on that. God bless you and RIP Danya.
- @notorioezz [2 hours ago]: What happened I think, is Danya took sleeping medication. Dosed off on stream, then, Kramnik tweets the "don't do drugs"' image.. Danya probably saw it and thought, fuck, given how people ran away with the cheating accusations, this probably also going to get traction, making everybody think he did drugs. He was backed into a corner, and saw no way out of it.  To me, it's clear, Danya started his stream well, focused, talking great, not acting weird. He never left the cam, so how did he do drugs in between? It's so clear, the sleeping pills started working 1 hour into the stream. Anyway, it's too late.. None of this brings him back. Even stripping Kramnik from titles. None of it will undo the irriversible damage done.

- @aaronpuetz4394 [2 hours ago]: Even if Kramnik does get his titles stripped, that won‚Äôt stop his harassment. I think the most important thing is to set the public record straight that Kramnik and his allies are spreading misinformation. Even if FIDE does nothing, I think it would go a long way if all the top players (maybe every GM, maybe top 100 male/female) got to choose to sign a petition acknowledging Kramnik‚Äôs claims as baseless. That way there‚Äôs at least a public consensus that his views are not shared by the sane majority. I also think Kramnik‚Äôs allies regurgitating his garbage need to be called out even if people might like them otherwise. Nepo has been giving Kramnik a bigger microphone and needs to be called out on it. Maybe privately, but if it continues publicly also.

We can't allow him to go on ruining young lives like he has done. And now he's taken a life. Who's next? For Emil to say no one spoke up? How about Danya HIMSELF!  Hikaru, Ben Feingold, the other accused?? They all spoke up and Emil did NOTHING!! FIDE is a joke and Emil is incompetent as a leader. Sick sick sick people. I'm so sorry Daniel for how this sport (and your childhood idol) treated you. This world didn't deserve such a kind soul. RIP‚ù§
- @willsenay [2 hours ago]: At this point can we not just switch to a new governing body? I haven‚Äôt heard a single good sentiment towards FIDE for 5 years and this feels like it should be the last straw. Create a new system and circuit, permaban kramnik and strip his titles, instate Gukesh as the current world champion under the view of the new governing body, and then rework the world championship to incorporate all three time controls or work with top players like Magnus and Hikaru to determine what format would be most exciting and best representative of determining the ‚Äúbest‚Äù player in the world

Yet throughout this video Levy‚Äôs clearly insinuating a sewerslde (god i hate yt). His distress in his last stream was not particularly one-off either as he‚Äôs been vocal about the Kramnik stress for over a year (which could also have an opposite implication ofc).  I‚Äôm not gonna act like I have the full, verified details either, nor am I gonna act like Im as close to DN as a stranger than Levy, but by his own info admissions, this seems hasty - though Im not sure if anyone in his position could resist coming to conclusions in lieu of autopsy.   Anyways, rip Danya.

Such a lowlife scum to put up those posts after Danya's passing and the fact that this has happened to other people is enough grounds for someone to sue him and also FIDE to strip this SOCIOPATH of his achievements and put him in place. If Emil Sutovsky does not have the gall or the mental comprehension to look at this like a human being he should resign and let someone else take over.

Not knowing the players in this community, but I want to comment on the first post showed in this video, seemed more like a person lashing out and angry by Daniel's passing; I have seen this before where a person blames others when they angry about a death of a person, sometimes angry at themselves.

All this stripping World championship title and all will damage the institutions current chess world is built upon. Do not go and try to change history, attack the person not who he was. Give him life imprisonment if you want but don't damage chess ffs. It'll set precedence to bring cancel culture into chess world.
- @TravofAllTrades [3 hours ago]: The speculation here by blaming Kramnik is that what he said led solely to Danya's mental destabilization and the underlying suggestion is that he passed due to some sort of intentional or accidental ending of his life. To blame Kramnik is the easy way out and irresponsible. Unless there was a note or some sort of communication, we have no idea what specifically was haunting Danya. However it happened (drug OD, or otherwise) Kramnik wasn't there, he didn't push it on him. People handle harsh words and criticism differently, some are more sensitive and less equipped with coping mechanism tools. Emil's tweet may sound callous and it shouldn't be placing the blame on anyone. Ultimately one person and one person only is responsible for Daniel Naroditsky, and that is Daniel Naroditsky. Sometimes people refuse help, sometimes there is nothing you can do. The human condition is such that we always want to fix something, always wish we could have done more. I'm sure everyone is searching for answers, but what's done is done. All we can do now is move on, heal and learn. RIP Daniel Naroditsky.
- @jaedong1957 [3 hours ago (edited)]: Unfortunately it was Magnus who opened that pandora box and showed that you can accuse someone of cheating without any proofs and get away with it. We are lucky that Hans is mentally tough. Because baseless accusations from Magnus did damage his career A LOT.  (I'm not defending Kramnik here. I hate this guy and hope he will be stripped of his titles and brought to legal justice for his actions)

- @mauriciorichards193 [3 hours ago]: I realize this might not be a popular comment since it doesn‚Äôt align with the sentiment of the video or most comments here. I‚Äôve followed Danya for years and always admired his passion for chess, his teaching, and his kindness.  It‚Äôs natural, after losing someone we admire, to want justice or to make sure their passing isn‚Äôt in vain. I felt something similar when I lost my best friend at 18 ‚Äî that urge to see accountability and meaning.  That said, I don‚Äôt believe Danya passed directly because of Kramnik‚Äôs accusations. We don‚Äôt truly know the cause, though we can presume it was the result of him not handling the pressure he faced.   Words can be powerful, but only when we choose to believe, give them attention, or amplify them.  If we respond by trying to punish Kramnik, say, by stripping his title ,we might feel a short-term sense of justice, but in doing so, we risk something deeper: continuing to create a culture where unpopular opinions are punished rather than challenged or ignored. Something we seem to be experiencing every day now.  Instead of seeking retribution, I think the best action is to deny these people the attention they seek. When we stop listening, their power fades, and we prevent the consequences of their words without harming ourselves or free speech in the process.

- @ShowenOtto [3 hours ago (edited)]: 12:45 Unfortnately, Daniel was mentally weak, and let baseless accussations get to him.  As you mentioned earlier, you can't control others. You can only control your own actions.  I was unaware of the drama, just got into the chess world a month ago.  But if I was Daniel's friend, I would have told him.  Strong body, strong mind. Get in the gym first.  If the accussations continued and got more personal.  Challenge Kramnik to a boxing fight, and f*ck him up.  That's how you deal with a bully.  There is always self accountability to be taken, but of course the next solution would be to discourage Kramniks actions.  But bullying on social media is pretty much a feature, thanks to X, and you must have thick skin.  Especially for the stage he was on.  RIP Daniel Naroditsky.

- @smoorej [3 hours ago]: Kramnik is a washed-up former champion angry that he can be beaten by teenagers now. Rather than accept the fact that time marches on, he accuses the world of cheating in order to hold up the fragile scaffolding of his massively overinflated ego. He is an evil, despicable troll and should be stripped of his titles, banned OTB and online, and allowed to live out the remainder of his life in shane, shouting snd everyone, listened to by no one.  As for FIDE, the CEO should publicly apologize and resign. How does he know what Danya‚Äôs friends snd family did or didn‚Äôt do? What an absolutely disgusting, disgraceful post, blaming them on the day of his funeral.    Lastly, thank you Levy for your heartfelt response and for saying what needs to be said. So sorry about the loss of your friend; may Danya‚Äôs memory forever be a blessing.

- @fadi.hammadeh [3 hours ago]: Although Danya‚Äôs official cause of death remains unknown at this point in time, one doesn‚Äôt need a degree in psychology to see the toll that Kramnik‚Äôs reckless and unfounded accusations have taken on him over the past two years. Even in his final stream, Danya spoke of the lingering psychological effect of those claims , the sense of being unfairly targeted, questioned, and publicly shamed for something he hasn‚Äôt done. What‚Äôs striking is how many leading chess players remained silent, fearful that the bully might retaliate with defamation suits against his victims. Only a few found the courage to speak up. The result was a culture of fear, one that allowed the bullying to persist largely unchecked. Under U.S. law, what Danya endured would likely qualify as slander, a civil wrong. At worst, it borders on reckless endangerment or even involuntary manslaughter when considering the foreseeable emotional consequences of sustained, baseless attacks. Under Russian law, however, the criminal code directly addresses infliction of death by negligence. Kramnik‚Äôs relentless, reckless, self-serving and delusional campaign against Danya‚Äôs integrity may well fall under that definition. Whether or not FIDE chooses to act is secondary now. What‚Äôs truly warranted is criminal accountability. Because what happened to Danya (RIP) wasn‚Äôt just controversy, it was targeted cruelty with foreseeable consequences.
- @twainrocks4771 [2 hours ago]: I've been watching Danya's Speedrun's since like January or so. His videos really helped me improve and he was just so kind, entertaining and fun. Always so eloquent, and so hood at explaining stuff. And then seeing the thumbnail of his latest Speedrun video saying "I'm Back", I was excited to watch it. Then to see, just 2 days later on a Gotham video "RIP Daniel Naroditsky". Honestly, I giggled for half a second seeing the the thumbnail, thinking, "damn, did Danya lose that badly, lol?". But then It felt off, because the image of Danya on the thumbnail was too normal. No edits. I didn't even click open the video, and I went to Google. I'm shocked. I'm seeing "Daniel Naroditsky was an American chess grandmaster and internet personality". I'm seeing passed tense everywhere, and then at the bottom of the page, It says he is dead.  I don't really know how to feel. I'm gutted. No more Speedrun's, no more grinding Elo while copying Danya's favorite openings. No more Danya videos while eating dinner. For a good few weeks, hell even months, I'd sit alone and watch Danya videos while eating dinner. Id watch Danya videos when I was having traumatic flashbacks.  Danya is a chess legend, and was a legend well before passing away. I really feel bad, with the possibility that this was a su*cide, and the fact that Kramnik continues to act like a psychopath. I hope his family is feeling better, and I hope his older brother continues to play chess, the game Danya loves.

I don't know if there is any precedent for this in chess and I understand that the title comes from purely your skill and achievements as a chess player but kramnik's whole thing works on the fact that he has this stamp of credibility in being  grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik. There is no other option but to strip him of that title, because that stops his voice from having any credibility with people who may not be familiar with the current events of this community.

- @Nothingn…ôss [3 hours ago]: Bold of you to assume your the "good guy" here. Magnus was wrong, but that doesn't make Hans innocent. He has admitted to cheating in the past, is it really that insane to think Magnus accused this ex-cheater of cheating again? Get a grip you insensitive clown.   With that aside, let's come to the original topic. Being a "grown ass man" does not make a guy immune to depression, no clue where you got that idea from. You call yourself a Danya fan, yet you attempt to mock rightful Kramnik haters? Kramnik was the reason why Danya got thrown into the darkest trenches of depression, the cheating allegations ruined him mentally. Little ol' you, talking about how people should "have the same energy" like stfu. You are proof that not everyone deserves access to the internet.

- @brianmahoney2079 [4 hours ago]: RIP man sorry, the drama is sucking me in
- @libertarianbydefault [4 hours ago]: I am making a comment as someone who is NOT that familiar with any of the main characters (I mean, I know the names and basic background info, but not all the nuances of the drama), but from a purely logical standpoint. Blaming Kramnik for all the bad things that happen is lazy. Blaming Naroditsky's close ones for not "taking action" is also lazy. The system is ludicrous for not having a robust set of procedures for this kind of thing. Accusations of cheating or any other underhanded practices should be taken seriously. They cannot be dismissed saying "That person is crazy, this guy - we love him, he could never do anything wrong.", nor should it be the other way around. It is the governing body's responsibility to handle this stuff and pass official verdict.  Suggestions of stripping Kramnik of titles or somehow punishing him for being 'mean' are also ludicrous. This is hardcore censorship and would basically prove his point. A lot of people around the world suffer from all sorts of accusations, both legit and wrongful - in sports, in politics, in media, etc. Committing suicide because of that is neither a solution nor can it be used as grounds for punishing the accusers. So, I do agree with Levy, at least in part, when he says that FIDE should actually do something. Not punish Kramnik, but devise a clear system and methodology for addressing these issues in a regulated fashion.  For the sake of a hypothetical, imagine that Kramnik is right and Naroditsky was cheating. So then what? Naroditsky deserved to die? Of course not - that conclusion would be insane, yet it would be hard to blame Kramnik for saying what would have essentially been true. So why is it that the other option - the one where Naroditsky is wrongfully accused - warrants putting all blame on Kramnik? Because he said something that was wrong? Millions of people say things that are wrong every day, in many cases those things may seriously hurt other people. My point here is that Kramnik's accusations, regardless of their validity, and the tragic outcome - if the two things are related - cannot and should not be interpreted as the accuser is to blame for the death of the accused, otherwise we can go down a very, very slippery slope. Defamation lawsuits, official governing body investigations - yes. Knee-jerk reactions and witch hunts - no.  I hope I made at least some sense and am open to a conversation on this rather complicated and controversial topic. Condolences to the family and close ones of Daniel Naroditsky - regardless of the circumstance of his passing, it is a tragedy. RIP.  And yes, FIDE's post is a disgrace - they are dodging responsibility. Not for Naroditsky's demise, but for being incompetent and for neglecting their duties - regulating and making the world of chess a lot more nice, fair, open and transparent. A reform is long overdue.
- @palmtop_dragon [4 hours ago]: While Kramnik's conduct is certainly disgusting, I don't share the sentiment of seeking "justice" from FIDE by stripping him of his title. A player's achievements on the chessboard shouldn't be revoked because of behavioural issues. The hard truth is that Naroditsky took his own life because he found himself vulnerable to the ramblings of very few internet trolls. Let's not forget that the vast majority of the chess community saw Kramnik's allegations as baseless and ridiculous. If the same rules that you ask FIDE to introduce (and retroactively apply) would be in place, the likes of you and Hikaru would have to be held accountable for how you milked the Niemann situation for months. I'm against a punishment based on the outcome rather than the action.

- @JusticeExplorer [4 hours ago (edited)]: To anyone who could afford to do so, I highly recommend dropping social media altogether. It's a beautiful weightless feeling.   Levy feels hopeless, and that makes sense becuase frankly, companies and organizations don't actually care about these things until they stop getting what they want, so you can't give it to them. They arent humans, they are a system designed to serve a function, and they don't care about the same things as us.  RIP Danya
- @bewarethechameleon [4 hours ago]: a loss like this hasn't been felt this badly since reckful passed, and a lot of the conversations we had now are the same convos we had back then to. all we know is that we did the best we can do to support him in life and now we support him in death. depression is a disease, not helped by the vile actions of kramnik and others. but now is the time is come together and remember daniel for the legend he is. RIP danya
- @Savvaty_films [4 hours ago]: Please people, DO NOT VILLAINIZE Kramnik! You're saying stuff as he himself pressured Danya to KILL himself, WHICH IS NOT TRUE !  Yes, the pressure of Kramnik's accusations was big and I DON'T symphasize\condone all that critique and pointless blames that Kramnik does, - WE MUST REMEMBER, that all this is NOTHING like forcing someone to a suicide!  Those accusations were pointless, and I suppose that 99% of chess community KNEW that, and I'm sure that most comments that Danya had were saying that they are with him on that matter, that they believe him. (As were his friends, I'm sure)  BUT  I can't understand why we AS A SOSCIETY think that SUICIDE was an appropriate response from a 29 years old Danya !!  The whole suicide thing is a complete lack of will to live, lack of strength AND A LACK OF BELIEF IN GOD most of all !!!   SO - I'm saying - Yes, chess authorities NEED TO CALM KRAMNIK DOWN with all his occusations work. BUT don't forget about freedom of speech, that USA still have! - that means that Kramnik CAN say whatever dumb shit he wants! AND I'm sure that most chess players DO KNOW that this (for the most part) IS DUMB shit.  BUT WE SHOULDN`t forget the past, we shouldn't strip GMs of any past titles  just because they are old now and have some trust issues - that's not fair. HISTORY IS NOT THE ONE TO REWRITE !
- @RealMirakuru [4 hours ago]: I live on the other side of the planet, yet feel just as heartbroken and sick as any of Danya's friends. How is this any less than murder?   I'm really going to miss his speedruns, his commentary full of iconic reactions, and his quick puns and jokes.  RIP Daniel ‚ù§

- @raymaverick5507 [4 hours ago]: RIP Danya. He never deserved thisüíîüíî
- @ruiribeiro1105 [4 hours ago]: I don't usually share my opinions online but this matter really affected me, I admired Danya a lot... The reality is: there is no way to silence Kramnik. But, the solution should be removing whatever power his voice still has. Just like Hikaru said, he is a former World Champion and that is what causes damage. It isn't just some rando throwing accusations and that is what affected David Navarro, Danya, Hikaru and many others. They aren't simple accusations. No, they come from a person in a "position of power". So I say we take all that power. Strip him of his title. Scratch his name from chess history books. Remove his name and his ELO from the records, no more invites. Let him go back to play in parks in Russia if he so pleases but for the rest of the world, let him be a nobody. Sure, we will all know who he is, we will all know he was a World Champion but you know what else we know? That this has never happened in the past. No Chess World Champion has ever forcefully been stripped of his title and status because the chess WORLD demanded it. And that counts for something. That should tell us enough. He is not worthy of the status that comes from being a Chess World Champion. There are no politics here, only a glimpse of justice. And Danya deserved it. He deserved much better. So if you have to line the top 100 players in the world, do it. If you have to launch an online petition and get more than a million signatures, here is mine. Whatever it takes, take away his power and let him be a nobody, sharing his conspiracy theories and exposing the so called Chess Mafia to his 50 resident tweeter followers and probably his poor neighbours that have to put up with his shit
- @andrewterrasol [4 hours ago]: No PhD is needed to see how Danya's mental, emotional, and physical downturn started with Kramnik's MAD DOG attacks! We, as a society, still have not learned how to deal with sociopaths; toxic, dysfunctional minds, and they keep destroying lives. Only a unified response that takes away their sociopathic avenues can end their destruction. Historically, we have always been too slow to act, and we still are. Some things, if not immediately challenged, will grow like a cancer and become impossible to stop. Kramnik is a predator that found easy prey in Daniel. Daniel did not have the personal strength/fire like Hikaru to fend off and ignore Kramnik. I saw many people helping him try to cope with this, but in the end, he was just too good for this world; he could not bring himself to kill the evil that was killing him. Maybe more could have been done for Danya, but I think the true failure was in not containing Kramnik. RIP Danya, the world is dimmer without you, you will be missed, hope you are now surrounded in more of the light and love that you embodied  ‚ù§

- @JLWade40 [4 hours ago]: I lost a friend to suicide many years ago and recognize the stages of grief rippling through the chess community.  Here's the thing I learned that I hope others here will progress toward eventually: there is no explanation for suicide. We're not owed one, and we'll never get one.  Everyone in the chess community is looking for an explanation (someone or something to blame.) Kramnik is a piece of shit, but we already knew that. Think about this -- even if he took full responsibility for his actions, full responsibility for Danya's death, resigned his own championship, etc., would anyone feel satisfied or like the loss was sufficiently explained?  No. Not at all. So if that's not the real answer, what is?  Grief is a process. Gotham and Hikaru and you and me and even Sutovsky are in that process right now. Let it proceed and try to leave some room for grace for yourself and others to make mistakes during that process.  Then, when ready, remember the person we lost for the things you miss about them -- not the mistake they made at the end that you desperately want to correct.
- @hassanihaji105 [4 hours ago]: The problem here is exactly that ppl with voices saying they don‚Äôt kno what to do you guys know exactly what needs to be done u guys need to ban him completely revoke his title make him a nobody bcz a life was lose due to so much criticism that was lead by kramnik everything that kramnik has accomplished needs to turn to dust all his videos need to get deleted bcz SOMEONE HAS PASSED!

- @sporegazm [4 hours ago]: I have been in the darkest of places the last 2 years and chess has contributed to it immensely.  I wanted so badly to achieve my chess goals and it unfortunatelt has never happened and never will.  I have shared a small sliver of my struggles on my channel.    I became saturated and obsessed in it for 2 years.  And one of the most brightest lights during my hell was daniel naroditsky and his videos.   The way he spoke and explained things resonated with me so well.  Him and john barthlamew are my favourite.   And they both share many things in common.  They inspire me with their kindness and attitude.   Daniel seemed like such an amazing guy.   That scene where he was holding space for ivanchuk to weep...it was powerful the way he handled that.  I have thought some very very dark thoughts and how the world would be a much better place without me.  And i know no one would be making youtube videos or comments about me.  It goes to show that no matter how many peoples lives you touch, you still can't escape your own demons. :/  not assuming he did what many are thinking.   I know he battled insomnia same as i do.  And perhaps this is all an unfortunate accident he had during his struggles.     I didnt even know him and i feel this loss deeply.   But it also gives me perspective.  There is a world outside of the 64 squares and a world outside of the demented sick people accusing you of cheating on the 64 squares.  And a world outside the demented sick world of people blaming his friends for the tragedy (disgusting).  Wish daniel had a chance to step away from it all and find a new lease on life.  RIP daniel.  You will be missed

Not only for his incomprehensible, baseless accusations on Daniel and others, but the comments made shortly after Daniels passing, says enough by itself. Not ONE ounce of empathy for Danya. And then to ADD INSULT TO INJURY, Emil Sutovsky, the CEO OF FIDE, posts that disgusting tweet?! It's beyond vile, Emil hijacked this tragedy within the community, for what? To primarily blame & guilt-trip Daniel's friends, the ones who hurt the most, the ones who are most vulnerable, following his untimely death.   These people have no shame. Danya deserved much better. Emil should resign. Kramnik should be banned. If not, it might be time to boycott FIDE.
- @Zeergruush [4 hours ago]: Emil and Kramnik can both go step on a Lego. That's the most civil comment I can give about this right now. To you Gotham, from someone who lost a friend to hopelesness at age 12, take care of yourself. Don't let these psychopaths make you feel like you didn't "do enough to save him". Emil absolves himself of his own blame by saying he wasn't really his friend but saw him being unwell... My brother in christ, you're the head of FIDE, you can reach out and help this man more than most. Because if you say, hey, Kramnik is nuts, nobody actually thinks you're cheating, don't worry about it, it probably helps more than Magnus or whoever. There is, unfortunately, nothing any of his friends could've done. We clearly saw that with the last stream. They tried their damnest but it just wasn't enough. Imagine if FIDE had cracked down on the Kramnik stuff earlier, imagine if FIDE had done anything to support the person the CEO of FIDE "saw was clearly unwell". Give 'em hell for this transgression and rest assured we will be covering your back o7 RIP Danya.

He‚Äôs already gone down in history as one of the greatest players ‚Äî that can‚Äôt be disputed. He and his games aren‚Äôt going anywhere; they‚Äôll remain in the books.)  I believe that, in his own mind, he thought he was doing the right thing. He didn‚Äôt think about the consequences, but now he‚Äôs facing them. He should apologize first and foremost to Dani‚Äôs family, and then to everyone he accused. He needs to understand ‚Äî and make his fans understand ‚Äî that such methods are destructive.  Even if he had successfully exposed and banned thousands of cheaters, it still wouldn‚Äôt be worth a single human life. But I still don‚Äôt think he deserves the hatred (including physical threats) that he‚Äôs now facing. Many of those who are posting angry comments under Kramnik‚Äôs posts were, not long ago, happily watching his argument with Jos√© as if it were just another show. Most of them never thought about what such methods could lead to.  The problem of cheating is far too global; you can‚Äôt fight it by accusing individual players. But that‚Äôs a separate topic ‚Äî one I‚Äôd rather forget about right now.
- @gauransh.a.chopra6289 [4 hours ago]: Kramnik is just an asshole.

- @tysquirt111 [5 hours ago]: Speaking only from an objective standpoint, Kramnik had a valid criticism of the cheating system, but went about it in completely the wrong way. He deserves to be banned and have his title stripped, with a conditional return allowed only if he is never allowed to publicly accuse or attack anyone else. A third party needs to be created to review games accused of cheating, and they need to be 100% anonymous, with rotating members. A chess jury duty type system in place. Call it Daniel's Fair Play Committee. In that way, there is no bias. Only display the ratings, never say who is playing, and display the format. It's the most objective way to handle accusations of cheating.  Kramnik NEEDS some form of punishment. His repeated and unfounded attacks on Danya need to have real consequences, because it has a real impact on Danya's life. There needs to be an appropriate punishment for defamation. I don't know that a lifetime ban is fair, because at the end of the day, I don't believe Kramnik wanted Danya to die. But at the end of the day, that was an indirect consequence of his direct action. There's no excuse for his behavior, especially when it's a pattern of behavior. I know I'm just a guy, but I sincerely hope that there is an appropriate level of punishment for Kramnik, and an overhaul of the Fair Play system. Rest in peace Danya, your chess games are immortalized in our hearts.

(Whether that'd in practice have made a difference to VK since he's not an active player and financially independent in his own right is another matter).  I still can't believe it.

Again, don't let these guys downplay it or try to blame anybody else. We know what contributed for this tragedy and this has to be stopped. Kramnick is a shame. RIP Danya!
- @bootssocks6477 [5 hours ago]: RIP Daniel Naroditsky. But Emil is right ‚Äî where were all of you, his so-called 'friends,' when he was being publicly bullied by Kramnik? His smile clearly faded day by day after the accusations. You all should have supported Daniel publicly. If you had shown this courage a little earlier and called out Kramnik, Daniel might still have been with us today. üò≠üò≠

- @corybrown8422 [5 hours ago]: What need to happen is that a lot of the top players need to get together and stop playing in FIDE tournaments until Emil publicly apologizes for doing nothing and strips Kramnik of everything chess. That is the only way anything will change. But it won't happen.
- @GGmanlife [5 hours ago]: I am under the opinion at this point that the only way forward for FIDE, Emil, and Kramnik, is for Kramnik to have his title stripped and be outright banned from everything chess, and also to have Emil step down. I don‚Äôt care about anything else concerning FIDE ‚Äî Emil is simply so vile that I won‚Äôt support the entire company until he is done for. Of course the same vileness applies to Kramnik, but that goes without being said.
- @DerFliegendeMocca [5 hours ago]: wow i mean, i was joking about cheaters in chess just 2-3 days ago. how bitter bitter is this story. im honest, im not good with names and dont really look up to people - not my thing - but how sad is it, that someone gets accused of cheating so much that it cripples his real non-cheating amazing performance to THIS degree. as much as i understand this, he took his life, right? lets not censor this here. depression and suicide are serious topics. if you feel unwell with yourself, if you are struggeling with work or hobbies or people, find help. NOW. its a time bomb. ive lost not many, but obviously of course TOO MANY people to suicide. find help. and if you are - maybe a bit like me - a troll from time to time, rethink your actions. its really sickening seeing that the over-performance in a game and the cheating accusations lead to THIS. play the game. have fun. be angry, be happy, be arrogant, be a shit-talker, but dont drive someone into suicide over a fucking game. even if he is maybe a cheater even (i dont know, honestly, no clue, doesnt matter). just a game. and for semipros/pros its work. its their life.

I will never utter that person's name again, but I agree with your thought of stripping him of his titles. Its a small gesture in light of his cruelty but maybe it would lesson the soap box he uses to destroy lives.  God bless Danya. He will be remembered.
- @IIIAnchani [5 hours ago]: Kramnik should be stripped of name and title in chess. He should be erased from the chess books and he should be publically named persona non grata by FIDE. That is what true integrity would mean. That the name Naroditsky will live on in the chess world, to be remembered for his brilliance and his beautiful soul and that the person who is (in my opinion) directly responsible for this tragedy shall be forgotten and never to be named again in the chess world.
- @someonek3632 [5 hours ago]: How much damage Kramnik needs to do before he's stopped? Wasn't Daniel's suicide enough to finally do something about this atrocity?

If you believe in yourself then that kind of thing wouldn't get to you since you would know it's not true. It wouldn't get to me very much personally. I understand Danya being very disturbed since it's different than what you mentioned, and I understand that everyone feels things differently too. This is different because Kramnik was someone who he looked up to and former world champion, and it's not something he could ignore. Kramnik was trying to ruin his reputation in a game that he loved and he had no evidence. He bullied him for months at a time, and Kramnik is a big name in the chess world, despite his recent insanity. I feel very sad for Danya, his poor family. RIP Danya.

- @dennisfi7683 [5 hours ago (edited)]: I totally totally agree with you, and what kramnik has done and is doing is terrible. But trying to silence Kramnik wont bring any good... This would be true censorship. And it would just give him more reasons to fight for whatever he is fighting for. In my opinion, although it seems nearly impossible, we should stop giving kramnik any recognition in any way. Let him do his thing, but stop listening to him, until He is a lonely old man mumbling his insane thoughs in solitude, how it should be... I am not saying that is realistically possible since people love drama and will keep giving him a platform, but silencing him wont bring any good, it has never done that in the history of humanity. RIP Danya ‚ù§
- @Michas2820 [5 hours ago]: Kramnik is most likely a narcissist, a very manipulative evil and abusive creature, and should face some serious consequences for what he has done. These people can make you go crazy, lose your mind and totally destroy your mental health, and it's sadly something we've seen happen to Daniel. I've been through a relationship with a narcissist once so I know what I'm talking about, it leaves some serious mental scars on your psyche that are very hard if not impossible to heal from. Mental health is no joke people, take it seriously and take seriously any form of abuse that you see whether it be in real life or on the internet, as it can really damage someone who did not deserve it at all. RIP Daniel Naroditsky, I've learned so much from you watching your Youtube channel and your streams on Twitch, I hope you find some peace wherever you might now be, fly high angel.

Magnus & Kramnik and whomever in the chess community who has large following they should understand their power and should not make the life of other difficult (unless they have clear evidences - which both cases none of the accuseres have).  Cyber Bullying should STOP  Just because Hans has the mental strength to cope up with all his allegations doesn't mean you all are "GOOD"
- @reveriesend4668 [5 hours ago]: What do you do? Strip Kramnik off his title (all of them, so not just the WC, but also GM). Strip Emil from his position and his title (GM, I mean). and put an ultimatum on FIDE to do these two things.  That or all chess players and chess clubs should leave FIDE and make their own org.  And of course it will need Gukesh, of all people, since he's the current classical champion. (so his championship should translate to this new org, instead of FIDE.)
- @Citizen7777 [4 hours ago]: ‚Äã¬†@Hasinoyomoy¬† I don't hate Kramnik or blame him for anybody's mental issues. Get a grip.
- @ZeNuske22 [4 hours ago]: @Citizen7777¬† Except there were no mental issues until Kramnik started attacking Danya online and that's when he went downhill. Are you seriously that ignorant? Danya said himself multiple times that the Kramnik accusations were the reason for his mental downfall, including on his final stream a day or so before his death. Don't tell other people to get a grip when you clearly have some skewed view of reality yourself. Danya was accused relentlessly for years, bullied by Kramnik again and again and again with no proof of his claims. Where I'm from constant online harassment that clearly plays a contributing factor in the death of the targeted individual comes with a jail sentence and there's clearly enough evidence from Danyas past streams as well as all the disgusting vile posts from Kramnik (even post-humous) to prove the correlation. You try having someone you idolised as child repeatedly berate and harass you online for two straight years and see how that affects your mental health. Though judging from your comment I find it hard to believe you have any ability to feel human emotion at all.
- @ahmadzahraniAAZ [2 hours ago]: I agree with the old badger being overthrown, both of them. But erasing his legacy?... so what, his chess championships do not count? He did not cheat, he did not do anything illegal in the game of chess, or violate the spirit of it, what he did was related to chess only as a curtain (or however part fits, I'm bad with this analogy). And trying to punish a man and strip him from the records, all it does is open a pandora's box, everyone before and after him is liable to getting banished if they do something unrelated. For example, if Capablanca was found out to have said something out of line, who did Alekhine beat to become world champion, THE AIR??
- @AntonioCrazyxD [52 minutes ago]: ‚Äã¬†@ripperfisher182250¬†then I call you a bully and demand you be banned officially from all future competitions period. You are being a bully for trying to bully others out of the game. Due to your logic, I am right.  See how that works ?  See why nothing will change ? See why FIDE or nobody can do anything to stop Kramnik ? Do what ? Change rules ? Now you invalidate every legitimate player in the past, legends, people who actually represented chess and the social game behind it. And you invalidate all future competitions....  Ironically, you all lose. And nobody wins.  Wanna know the plain truth? Daniel Naroditsky made the choice to kill himself. That's simple enough. No one made him do anything. The brutal truth? Kramnik was less wrong than everyone else. There's so much skeletons in the closet Levy, Nakamura, Magnus.. Everyone is hiding and covering one another, scandals, things better left in the dark. üòä  So yeah, good luck trying to get what YOU want out of this you selfish individual. Human nature never changes.

- @ricardzubimendifelip9039 [5 hours ago (edited)]: Kramnik is absolutely appauling, but let's not forget what Magnus and Hikaru did to 19 year old Hans for almost a year. Just because Hans was able to cope with it better than Daniel doesn't make Carlsen and Nakamura less guilty. Considering how well Hans has been playing in the last two years and a half across the different time formats, it's pretty clear they got it completely wrong, and it's quite embarrassing the fact that when they are asked about it, they just claim Hans has improved a lot since the accusations.  Danya was probably my favorite chess commentator and I'm a huge fan of him as a speed chess player, just a brilliant guy. RIP Daniel Naroditsky‚ù§, you will never be forgotten.

At one point he says (as captured in summary transcripts) something along the lines of ‚ÄúThis is no smoking gun.‚Äù (i.e. he is explicitly distancing from claiming he has unequivocal proof)   He also makes remarks about how ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt prove you‚Äôre not cheating‚Äù unless you do something extreme (like ‚Äústrip naked‚Äù), which is a rhetorical way to highlight how difficult it is to disprove cheating claims completely.
- @serotonin2222 [5 hours ago]: For most people I have talked to, they felt that this was the only "celebrity" death that actually touched them to the core, because of how close people were to him through his streams and coaching videos.

- @danielwolde1698 [5 hours ago (edited)]: Step one, is to stop refering to kramnik as a world champion or former world champion, it only acts as a sign of respect that he doesnt deserve ever again.

You can be with someone 24/7, say all the right things, comfort them in all situations and it STILL might not be enough. The blaming of family and friends is disgusting without knowing anything about what was happening between them. The fact that you expect them to put on a show and say it all publicly so people like you can say "oh this was actually a good friend because they tweeted that they helped". Grow up.  You have the emotional maturity of a fucking rat if you can't realize how different people's brains can be wired and how the same things can impact people in such different ways. Idiot.

FIDE President, Emil didn‚Äôt even tweet once about Kramnik‚Äôs baseless accusations. And now, he wants to shift the focus away from Kramnik‚Äôs doings and blame the people and players close to Daniel instead.

- @Distractionalist [3 hours ago]: ‚Äã¬†@donkeychan491¬†Sociopath and psychopath are not real mental health diagnoses. It's unnecessary trying to distinguish between the 2 constructs because neither one of them is clearly defined in the psychological literature.  Based on your description and observations, he would be diagnosed as having "antisocial personality disorder with sadistic and grandiose features"

It would be appropriate now that Levy, magnus, hikaru, chessDot, botez sisters and the rest who tried to ruin Hans Niemanss life and reputation with no evidence, and truly apologize and try to make it right, Danya was the only one with the moral character to not accuse Niemann or lie about him. The only way to show true remorse is for levy to make a campaign that claims Justice for Niemann to try to make the world Danya deserved. RIP danya.  To admit he lied and make it right.

Again i understand why you are making this video. i cant say much after that without getting into too much trouble. Good Luck to Kramnik He definitely shouldve kept his mouth shut though. RIP DANYA I know he was no pushover and kramnik isnt strong enough to hurt him but this engine(system) is smh(73)

- @Waywind420 [5 hours ago]: Magnus and Hikaru, among others, helped spread unfounded butt-plug cheating accusations against a literal teenager, effectively destroying his reputation before he even had a chance to establish one...are we stripping them of all their achievements too??  Kramnik will never be as big a bully as those two.
- @AG-ur1lj [5 hours ago (edited)]: @delandchen5651¬†  I don‚Äôt think trying to stay level-headed = defending Kramnik. I mean, what does stripping him of his titles accomplish, aside from making angry people feel better? Titles are a reflection of your skill at chess, nothing more.   It‚Äôs kind of a risky precedent to set. What if it had been done earlier? Would it have helped completely discredit Kramnik, or would it have made his nonsense claims about censorship and fairplay conspiracy more believable? I don‚Äôt know because I don‚Äôt understand who was listening to him to begin with. It seems obvious to me that he is a fool‚Äîit also seems like everyone else thinks that too. Yet Danya seemed to get real messages from real doubters. Where do they come from? Are they Russian? Does Kramnik believe what he says? At times it seems like he must be lying intentionally, but other times I can‚Äôt see what the goal of lying could possibly be other than to convince people he‚Äôs an a**hole. I mean even now, he suggests substance abuse and ‚Äòchess mafia‚Äô involvement.   Anyway, the point is I think it‚Äôs reasonable to check yourself when you‚Äôre deciding how to punish someone you dislike. It‚Äôs easy to point at an injustice, but not so easy to find solutions that will actually prevent that injustice in the future. Do we ban everyone that says anything incorrect about another player? Where exactly are we drawing the line on what‚Äôs okay to say and what isn‚Äôt? What is the precise date that Kramnik‚Äôs behavior crossed over from being uncool to completely unacceptable?
- @tradingnoob6003 [4 hours ago]: ‚Äã¬†@AG-ur1lj¬†I actually don't know how FIDE should resolve this. If they mediated earlier it might have prevented this. Going forward, I think FIDE should have a committee that handles this kind of stuff especially for players who have large followings. If they can't prove their allegations and continued harassment, then suspension, then competitive play ban, then stripping of title and complete ban.
